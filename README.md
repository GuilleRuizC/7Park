**Objective** : The goal of this project is to initially predict the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) values using data modeling.

**Measurement of success** : The performance of our model will be tested using metrics such as R2 and mean squared error.

**Scope** : The model will be applied to housing data by zip codes from the American Community Survey years 2010-2020 and the datasets provided by 7Park Data and used to predict the ZORI for 2021. The population includes multifamily homes across the United States.

**Data Aggregation** : By zipcodes

**Target variable** : ZORI 

**Tools** : Google BigQuery, Jupyter Notebook, Rstudio, Plotly maps
