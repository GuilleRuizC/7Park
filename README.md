# Analysis and prediction of Zillow Rental Index (ZRI)

**Objective** : The goal of this project is to initially predict the Zillow Rent Index (ZRI) values using data modeling.

**Measurement of success** : The performance of our model will be tested using metrics such as R^2 and mean squared error.

**Scope** : The model will be applied to housing data by zip codes from the American Community Survey years 2015-2017 and the datasets provided by 7Park Data and used to predict the ZRI for 2018-2020. The population includes all homes across two cities, Phoenix and Tampa.

**Data Aggregation** : By zipcodes for cities Phoenix and Tampa

**Target variable** : ZRI 

**Tools** : Google BigQuery, Jupyter Notebook

**Analysis/Machine Learning** 
- Missingness/Imputation, 
- Feature Selection, 
- Feature Engineering, 
- Multiple Linear Regression, 
- Ridge/Lasso regression, 
- Tree ensembles, 
- Boosting, 
- Statistical Analysis.
